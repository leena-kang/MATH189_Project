## Dropout Analytics: Understanding Key Drivers for Dropout Students 
#### MATH 189 Winter 2024 Final Project 

### About the Project: 
Analyzed student data to understand key discrepancies between dropout and graduate students. Conducted various hypothesis testing, regression analysis, multivariate exploratory analysis to identify significant trends. Utilized these key features to implement a Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression Model to determine if there is any predictive power in a student's academic and socio-economic status with future academic success.

### Summary: 
The data showed students were more likely to drop out when: 1. married (or once married), 2. debtors, 3. did not receive scholarships, 4. not displaced, 5. exhibited lower grades during the second semester, and 6. dropped out during high school (or equivalent). These variables showed a significant impact on a student's success in graduating from a college or university compared to the many variables we investigated. 

The model suggests that these features potentially have predictive power (primarily for Portuguese schools). While there are some limitations within this model, it is still a strong indicator of a studentâ€™s academic success. 

This model can educate future students, educators, and parents to improve the graduation rate and educational experience of each student. Furthermore, this model assists in targeting specific students who have the key drivers mentioned above in order to provide the necessary resources and/or assist these students as an effort to decrease the dropout rate.
